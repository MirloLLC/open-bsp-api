# Open BSP API

An application built with [Deno ü¶ï](https://deno.land), powered by Postgres üêò and running on [Supabase ‚ö°](https://supabase.com) for scalable, modern backend infrastructure.

## Description

Open BSP API is a multi-tenant platform that connects to the official WhatsApp API to receive and send messages, storing them in a Supabase-backed database. Each organization (tenant) manages its own contacts and accesses the API using an individual API key, enabling simple integration with other services and systems.

The architecture is based on webhooks for receiving messages and conversations, and uses the Supabase client for reading and writing data. The API is designed to be simple and easy to integrate, supporting automation and custom workflows.

Optionally, the platform can include the `agent-client` module, which allows you to create lightweight agents or connect to external, more advanced agents (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) using different protocols like `a2a` and `chat-completions`. Lightweight agents can use built-in tools such as:

- MCP client
- SQL client
- HTTP client
- Calculator
- Transfer to human agent

Additionally, `agent-client` includes an "annotator" module that can interpret and extract information from media and document files, including:

- Audio
- Images
- Video
- PDF
- Other text-based documents (CSV, HTML, TXT, etc.)

## Roadmap

The roadmap includes support for new protocols:

- `responses` (OpenAI)
- `messages` (Anthropic)
- `generation` (Google)

Two more tools:

- Calendar (date calculator)
- Code execution (E2B)

An improved annotator (more/different providers por document type)
and more types:

- DOC
- XLS

## Deployment

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. [Fork me](https://github.com/matiasbattocchia/open-bsp-api/fork).
3. Configure the following secrets and variables for GitHub Actions in your repository settings.
4. Re-run the _Release_ action.

#### Secrets

- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: a [personal access token](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens).
<!-- - `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` -->

#### Variables

- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`: the `{id}` in `supabase.com/dashboard/project/{id}`.

## Local development

Requires Node üê¢ and Docker üêã.

### Database

```
npx supabase start
```

### Edge Functions

```
npx supabase functions serve
```

## Architecture

<img src="./architecture.png" alt="Architecture diagram" width="600">

In the image, green boxes are external services, red are Edge Functions and blue, database tables.
White boxes, clients, connect to the API via one of the Supabase [client libraries](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/client-libs).

The system uses a reactive, function-based architecture:

1. A request from the WhatsApp API is received by the `whatsapp-webhook` function.
2. `whatsapp-webhook` processes the incoming message and stores it in the `messages` table.
3. An insert trigger on the `messages` table forwards the message to the `agent-client` function (incoming trigger).
4. `agent-client` builds the conversation context and sends a request to an agent API using the [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) format.
5. `agent-client` waits for the agent's response and saves it back to the `messages` table.
6. An outgoing trigger on the `messages` table forwards the new message to the `whatsapp-dispatcher` function.
7. `whatsapp-dispatcher` processes the message and sends a request to the WhatsApp API to deliver it.

This event-driven flow ensures that each component is decoupled and scalable.

### Edge Functions

#### WhatsApp

- `whatsapp-webhook`: Handles incoming webhook events from the [WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api).
- `whatsapp-dispatcher`: Sends outbound messages to the WhatsApp Cloud API.
- `whatsapp-manager`: Integrates with the [WhatsApp Business Management API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api) for business and phone number management.

#### Agent

- `agent-client`: Orchestrates agent interactions, builds conversation context, and communicates with external agent APIs.

### Database models

- **users**: Registered user in the application.
- **organizations**: Tenant entity; holds organization metadata.
- **organizations_addresses**: Organization's addresses per service; belongs to an `organization`.
- **contacts**: People associated with an `organization` (address book).
- **conversations**: Conversation between an organization_address and a contact_address for a service; belongs to an `organization`, optionally to a `contact`.
- **messages**: Messages within a `conversation` context; carries direction, type, payload, status, and timestamps.
- **agents**: Human or AI agents for an `organization`; optionally linked to an auth `user`.
- **api_keys**: API access keys scoped to an `organization`.
- **webhooks**: Outbound webhook subscriptions per `organization`.
