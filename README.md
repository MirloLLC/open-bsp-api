# Open BSP API

The Open Business Service Provider API integrates with the [WhatsApp Business Platform 💬](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp). It is built with [Deno 🦕](https://deno.land), powered by [Postgres 🐘](https://www.postgresql.org) and runs on [Supabase ⚡](https://supabase.com) for scalable, modern backend infrastructure.

Open BSP is designed for both individual businesses and service providers. You can use it to manage your own WhatsApp messaging, or leverage its features to become a [Meta Business Partner](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers) and offer WhatsApp messaging services to other organizations.

## Description

Open BSP API is a multi-tenant platform that connects to the official WhatsApp API to receive and send messages, storing them in a Supabase-backed database. Each organization (tenant) manages its own contacts and accesses the API using an individual API key, enabling simple integration with other services and systems.

The architecture is based on webhooks for receiving messages and conversations, and uses the Supabase client for reading and writing data. The API is designed to be simple and easy to integrate, supporting automation and custom workflows.

Optionally, the platform can include the `agent-client` module, which allows you to create lightweight agents or connect to external, more advanced agents using different protocols like `a2a` and `chat-completions`. Lightweight agents can use built-in tools such as:

- MCP client
- SQL client
- HTTP client
- Calculator
- Transfer to human agent
- Attach file

Additionally, `annotator` module that can interpret and extract information from media and document files, including:

- Audio
- Images
- Video
- PDF
- Other text-based documents (CSV, HTML, TXT, etc.)

The `mcp` module utilizes an MCP server to provide agentic access to the API. For instance, you can send messages directly from clients like Claude Desktop or other agent platforms. In addition, most built-in tools—such as SQL, HTTP, and calculator—are also made available through the MCP server.

## Roadmap

The roadmap includes support for new protocols:

- `responses` (OpenAI)
- `messages` (Anthropic)
- `generation` (Google)

Two more tools:

- Calendar (date calculator)
- Code execution (E2B)

An improved annotator (more/different providers por document type)
and more types:

- DOC
- XLS

## Deployment

## WhatsApp Integration

To connect your WhatsApp API to your Supabase project, you'll need to configure the following Edge Functions secrets. You can set these up in two ways:

1. **Direct configuration**: Add them directly in your Supabase dashboard at Supabase > Project > Edge Functions > Secrets (`https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/{project_id}/functions/secrets`).
2. **GitHub Actions**: Set them as GitHub Actions secrets in your repository settings and re-run the _Release_ action to automatically deploy them.

#### Secrets

- `META_SYSTEM_USER_ID`
- `META_SYSTEM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `META_APP_ID`
- `META_APP_SECRET`
- `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`

Follow these steps to obtain the required credentials:

### Overview

There is quiet a Meta nomenclature of entities that you might want to get in order
to not to get lost in the platform.

- **Business profile** - This is the top-level entity, represents a business. Has users and assets.
- **User** - Real or system users. System users can have access tokens. Users belong to a business portfolio and can have assigned assets.
- **Asset** - WhatsApp accounts, Instagram accounts, Meta apps, among others. Assets belong to a business portfolio and are assigned to users.
- **App** - An asset that integrates Meta products such as the WhatsApp Cloud API.
- **WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)** - A WhatsApp account asset, can have many phone numbers.
- **Phone number** - A registered phone number within the WhatsApp Cloud API. Belongs to a WABA.

> **Note**: For more details, refer to [Cloud API overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/overview).

### Step 1: Create a Meta app (skip if you already have one)

1. Navigate to [My Apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)
2. Click **Create App**
3. Select the following options:
   - **Use case**: Other
   - **App type**: Business
4. Add the **WhatsApp** product to your app
5. Click **Add API**
6. Disregard the screen that appears next and proceed to the next step

### Step 2: Create a system user

1. Get into the [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com). If you have multiple portfolios, select the one associated with your app
2. Go to Settings > Users > System users (`https://business.facebook.com/latest/settings/system_users`)
3. Add an **admin system user**
4. Copy the **ID** → `META_SYSTEM_USER_ID`
5. Assign your app to the user with **full control** permissions
6. Generate a token with these permissions:
   - `business_management`
   - `whatsapp_business_messaging`
   - `whatsapp_business_management`
7. Copy the **Access Token** → `META_SYSTEM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN`

> **Note**: For detailed instructions on system user setup, refer to the [WhatsApp Business Management API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/get-started).

### Step 3: Get the app credentials

1. Navigate to [My Apps](`https://developers.facebook.com/apps`) > App Dashboard (`https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{app_id}`)
2. Go to App settings > Basic (`https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{app_id}/settings/basic`)
3. Copy the following values:
   - **App ID** → `META_APP_ID`
   - **App secret** → `META_APP_SECRET`

> **Note**: Multiple Meta apps are supported by separating values with `|` (pipe) characters. For example: `META_APP_ID=app_id_1|app_id_2` and `META_APP_SECRET=app_secret_1|app_secret_2`.

### Step 4: Configure the `WhatsApp Business Account` webhook

#### Part A

1. Within the App Dashboard
2. Go to WhatsApp > Configuration (`https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{app_id}/whatsapp-business/wa-settings`)
3. Set the **Callback URL** to: `https://{SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID}.supabase.co/functions/v1/whatsapp-webhook`
4. Choose a secure token for `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` → Set it as the **Verify token**, but do not **Verify and save** yet!
5. Ensure your Edge Functions environment variables are up-to-date
   - If you configured secrets directly in your Supabase dashboard, no further action is needed at this point
   - If you set secrets via GitHub Actions, re-run the _Release_ action now to deploy them to your Edge Functions
6. Click **Verify and save**
7. Disregard the screen that appears next and proceed to the next step

> **Note**: Multiple Meta apps are supported by appending the query param `?app_id={META_APP_ID}` to the callback URL. For example: `https://{SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID}.supabase.co/functions/v1/whatsapp-webhook?app_id=app_id_2`.

#### Part B

1. Within the App Dashboard
2. Go to WhatsApp > Configuration (`https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{app_id}/whatsapp-business/wa-settings`)
3. Subscribe to the following **Webhook fields**:
   - `messages`
   - `history`
   - `smb_app_state_sync`
   - `smb_message_echoes`

Optionally, test the configuration so far. In the `messages` subscription section, click **Test**. You should see the request in Supabase > Project > Edge Functions > Functions > whatsapp-webhook > Logs (`https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/{project_id}/functions/whatsapp-webhook/logs`).

You might observe an error in the logs. This is an expected outcome at this stage; the simple fact that a log entry appears confirms that the webhook is successfully receiving events.

### Step 5: Add a phone number

If you decide to add the **test number**,

1. Within the App Dashboard
2. Go to WhatsApp > API Setup (`https://developers.facebook.com/apps/{app_id}/whatsapp-business/wa-dev-console`)
3. Click **Generate access token** (you can't use the one you got from step 2 here)
4. Copy these values:
   - **Phone number ID**
   - **WhatsApp Business Account ID**
5. Select a recipient phone number
6. Send messages with the API > **Send message**

> **Note**: the test number doesn't seem to fully activate to receive messages unless you send a test message at least once.

In order to add a **production number**,

1. Click **Add phone number**
2. Follow the flow
3. Navigate to [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/overview)
4. Go to Account tools > Phone numbers (`https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/phone_numbers`)
5. Copy these values:
   - **Phone number ID**
   - **WhatsApp Business Account ID**

#### For any number you add

Create an organization if you haven't done that already.

```sql
insert into public.organizations (name, extra) values
  ('Default', '{ "response_delay_seconds": 0 }')
;
```

Note the **organization ID**.

Register the phone number with your organization in the system.

```sql
insert into public.organizations_addresses (address, organization_id, service, extra) values
  ('<Phone number ID>', '<Organization ID>', 'whatsapp', '{ "waba_id": "<WhatsApp Business Account ID>", "phone_number": "<Phone number>" }')
;
```

## Local development

Requires Node 🐢 and Docker 🐋.

### Database

```
npx supabase start
```

### Edge Functions

```
npx supabase functions serve
```

## Architecture

<img src="./architecture.png" alt="Architecture diagram" width="600">

In the image, green boxes are external services, red are Edge Functions and blue, database tables.
White boxes, clients, connect to the API via one of the Supabase [client libraries](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/client-libs).

The system uses a reactive, function-based architecture:

1. A request from the WhatsApp API is received by the `whatsapp-webhook` function.
2. `whatsapp-webhook` processes the incoming message and stores it in the `messages` table.
3. An insert trigger on the `messages` table forwards the message to the `agent-client` function (incoming trigger).
4. `agent-client` builds the conversation context and sends a request to an agent API using the [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) format.
5. `agent-client` waits for the agent's response and saves it back to the `messages` table.
6. An outgoing trigger on the `messages` table forwards the new message to the `whatsapp-dispatcher` function.
7. `whatsapp-dispatcher` processes the message and sends a request to the WhatsApp API to deliver it.

This event-driven flow ensures that each component is decoupled and scalable.

### Edge Functions

#### WhatsApp

- `whatsapp-webhook`: Handles incoming webhook events from the [WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api).
- `whatsapp-dispatcher`: Sends outbound messages to the WhatsApp Cloud API.
- `whatsapp-manager`: Integrates with the [WhatsApp Business Management API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api) for business and phone number management.

#### Agent

- `agent-client`: Orchestrates agent interactions, builds conversation context, and communicates with external agent APIs.

### Database models

- **users**: Registered user in the application.
- **organizations**: Tenant entity; holds organization metadata.
- **organizations_addresses**: Organization's addresses per service; belongs to an `organization`.
- **contacts**: People associated with an `organization` (address book).
- **conversations**: Conversation between an organization_address and a contact_address for a service; belongs to an `organization`, optionally to a `contact`.
- **messages**: Messages within a `conversation` context; carries direction, type, payload, status, and timestamps.
- **agents**: Human or AI agents for an `organization`; optionally linked to an auth `user`.
- **api_keys**: API access keys scoped to an `organization`.
- **webhooks**: Outbound webhook subscriptions per `organization`.
